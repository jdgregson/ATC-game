# ATC Game
An Air Traffic Control simulation/game. It can be played [here](http://jdgregson.com/atc-game/) or on any other website or computer it is downloaded to. It is written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Browser Support
ATC Game is written using many ES6+ features, meaning it will never support Inernet Explorer directly. Any full releases will be compiled in Babel to provide support for all browsers.
